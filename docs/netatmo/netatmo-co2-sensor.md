Procedure
Place your module in a well-ventilated room
Go to Settings > Manage my Home
Select the room where the main module of the Station is located
Click on the module
In Configurations select CO2
Launch a manual calibration by clicking on the corresponding button
Once the manual calibration request has been made, please do not disconnect the main module from its power supply or remove the batteries from the Additional Smart Indoor Modules for 8 consecutive hours.

To verify that the calibration is in progress, verify that a spinner is displayed on the recalibrate button or visit the Web app and check that the word ''calibration'' is flashing next to CO2 in the left column.

Note
Be sure to leave auto calibration enabled
