Spring Framework
Spring is a popular Java-based framework that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for building enterprise-grade applications.
It provides a powerful dependency injection mechanism called Inversion of Control (IoC) container.
Mature and widely used.
Rich ecosystem and integration with other Spring projects.
Suitable for building large, complex applications.
XML and annotation-based configurations.

Google Guice
Guice (pronounced “juice”) is a lightweight dependency injection framework developed by Google.
It is designed to be easy to learn and use, with minimal boilerplate code.
Lightweight and easy to learn.
Annotation-based configuration.
Good performance.

Dagger
Dagger is another lightweight dependency injection framework, initially developed by Square and now maintained by Google.
It is designed to be fast and efficient, using compile-time code generation to minimize runtime overhead.
Fast and efficient.
Compile-time dependency checking.
Supports Android development.

Micronaut
Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications.
It includes built-in support for dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming, making it stand out amongst other frameworks.
Optimized for microservices and serverless applications.
Fast startup time and low memory footprint.
Compile-time dependency injection and AOP, reducing the use of reflection and proxying.
Out-of-the-box support for reactive programming.
Built-in cloud-native features like service discovery, distributed tracing, and cloud functions.
Micronaut significantly outperforms Spring in terms of startup time and memory usage due to its Ahead -of-Time (AoT) compilation approach.
This feature's impact is more noticeable when working with microservices and serverless applications that need to start quickly and consume fewer resources.
