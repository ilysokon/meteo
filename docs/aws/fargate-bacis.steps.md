Here are the basic steps to get started with AWS Fargate:

1. Create an ECS cluster. This will be the logical grouping of tasks and services that Fargate will run on. 
   You can do this through the AWS console or CLI.
2. Build your container image. Your application code needs to be packaged into a Docker container image and stored in a registry like ECR.
3. Create a task definition that specifies the container image, CPU/memory resources and other configuration details. 
   This defines what your Fargate tasks will look like.
4. Create a Fargate service that links to the task definition. This launches the desired number of tasks across availability zones.
5. Configure networking and load balancing if needed. Services get private IPs by default, so you may want to add public IPs, load balancers etc.
6. Update the task count as needed for scaling. Fargate will automatically add/remove tasks based on the desired count.
7. Integrate with services like secrets manager, databases etc. using service discovery or environment variables.
8. Monitor logs and metrics using CloudWatch. Fargate integrates with this service out of the box.

ECR Registry:
    Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. With ECR, you can securely store private Docker images in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

    The basic workflow for using ECR with Fargate would be:

    1. Create an ECR repository to store your Docker images. 
        You can do this through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
    2. Build your Docker image locally following best practices. Tag it with your repository URI (e.g. 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app).
    3. Use the AWS CLI to authenticate and push the image to ECR:
        aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
        docker push 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app
    4. Reference the image in your Fargate task definition by URI. Fargate will pull it from ECR on launch.

    1.1. To create an ECR repository:
        Log in to your AWS account and open the Amazon ECR console.
          https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/12/amazon-ecr-console-version-2/
        Choose Repositories from the navigation menu, then choose Create repository.
        Enter a repository name (e.g. "my-app"). The repository URI will be generated automatically in the form aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repositoryName.
        Choose Create to create the repository.
           Creation Details:
            Visibility settings: Private
            Repository name: 250065989959.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/geometeo
            Tag immutability: Disabled
            Image scan settings: Disabled
            Encryption settings: Disabled
            Created
        
        Via SDK(Java Example):
            
            import software.amazon.awscdk.core.Construct;
            import software.amazon.awscdk.core.Stack;
            import software.amazon.awscdk.core.StackProps;
            import software.amazon.awscdk.services.ecr.Repository;
            
            public class EcrRepoStack extends Stack {
                public EcrRepoStack(final Construct scope, final String id) {
                    this(scope, id, null);
                }
                
                public EcrRepoStack(final Construct scope, final String id, final StackProps props) {
                    super(scope, id, props);
                    
                        // Create the ECR repository
                        new Repository(this, "MyEcrRepo", {
                          repositoryName: "my-ecr-repo" 
                        });
                    }
                }
            }


        After creation completes, you can view the repository URI and use it to tag Docker images. When pushing images to ECR later, you'll need to authenticate first using the AWS CLI or SDK.
        Optionally, you can also setup lifecycle policies and other configurations as needed on the repository.
        That covers the basic steps for creating an ECR repository through the AWS Management Console. Let me know if you have any other questions!

        containerd
        EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) does support containerd as a container runtime. Some key points:
        
        EKS is Kubernetes distribution and is container runtime agnostic. It allows the usage of containerd, Docker, CRI-O etc.
        While Docker is still the most widely used, containerd is gaining popularity as an alternative runtime.
        Containerd provides some advantages like being optimized for container operations at scale and having clearer separation of concerns.
        To use containerd with EKS, you need to install the containerd runtime interface (CRI) and configure Kubernetes to use it instead of the default Docker runtime.
        EKS integrates with containerd through the CRI just like it does with Docker or other runtimes. So applications see no difference.
        Most Kubernetes distributions and managed services are adding containerd support to provide more choice in runtimes.
        So in summary, yes EKS supports containerd out of the box through its integration of the Kubernetes CRI framework. Let me know if you need help with any specific containerd or EKS configuration.
        
        To install the containerd runtime interface (CRI) on EKS to use containerd as the container runtime instead of the default Docker runtime, here are the basic steps:

            Install containerd on all your EKS worker nodes. You can use the official installation scripts from containerd.io.
            Configure containerd as the CRI runtime. Edit the containerd configuration file (/etc/containerd/config.toml) to set the CRI integration to true.
            Restart the containerd service for the changes to take effect.
            Configure Kubernetes to use containerd as the CRI runtime. Edit the kubelet configuration file (/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf) to set the container-runtime to remote and point it to the containerd socket.
            Restart the kubelet service. Kubernetes will now use containerd instead of Docker as the underlying container runtime.
            You can verify containerd is registered as the CRI by checking the Kubelet log or running "crictl ps".
        To set up containerd on terminated or replaced EKS worker nodes, you would follow these basic steps:

containerd:
1.     Install containerd on the new worker node using the official installation scripts from containerd.io. 
       This includes installing the containerd binary and configuring the service.
2.     Copy over the containerd configuration file (/etc/containerd/config.toml) from an existing worker node. This ensures the new node is configured the same way.
3.     Copy over the kubelet configuration file (/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf) and ensure the container-runtime setting points to containerd.
4.     Start the containerd and kubelet services on the new worker node.
5.     The node should now register with the EKS cluster control plane and Kubernetes will start scheduling pods on it.
6.     You can verify containerd is running as the CRI by checking the kubelet log or using "crictl ps" to list containers.

    EKS worker nodes can be configured in two main ways: [1]

   1. Managed node groups - With managed node groups, AWS manages and operates the underlying EC2 instances. This includes tasks like patching the operating system and Kubernetes software. You can specify certain configuration options like the instance type and AMI, but AWS handles the provisioning and lifecycle management of the nodes.
   2. Self-managed nodes - With self-managed nodes, you have more control over the configuration since you manage the EC2 instances yourself. This involves launching and configuring your own EC2 instances according to the EKS optimized AMI guidelines, and joining them to your cluster. AWS does not manage the instances lifecycle in this case. [2]

    Some key factors in deciding between the two options are operational overhead, configuration flexibility, and cost optimization. 
    Managed node groups reduce operational work, while self-managed nodes provide more customization ability if needed. 
    The documentation you had open discusses using ECR and Fargate, which is a serverless option where AWS manages the infrastructure.

The key is to ensure the new worker node is configured the same as others so containerd and Kubernetes see it as a replacement. 

    To set up containerd on managed EKS worker nodes, you would follow these basic steps: [1]

        1. Create an EKS cluster with managed node groups using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or an EKS control plane SDK like the AWS CDK. [2]
        2. When creating the managed node group, specify the EKS-optimized AMI for the operating system of your choice (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, etc). These AMIs come pre-installed with containerd. [3]
        3. No additional configuration is needed on the nodes themselves. EKS will automatically configure containerd as the CRI runtime on the managed nodes during launch.
        4. You can verify containerd is running as expected by checking the kubelet log on any node for messages about registering with the CRI runtime, or by using the crictl command line tool to list containers after deploying a pod.
        
    A few key points:

        * AWS manages the nodes so no manual containerd installation is required
        * EKS handles configuring containerd integration during node provisioning
        * Nodes use containerd out of the box as the CRI, no need to modify kubelet settings
        * Rolling upgrades will maintain the containerd configuration
    
    Whether an EKS cluster falls under the AWS Free Tier depends on the specific resources used:

        * The EKS control plane itself (which includes the Kubernetes API server and etcd cluster) is free. There is no additional charge for creating and managing an EKS cluster. [1]
        * EC2 instances used for EKS worker nodes do not qualify for the Free Tier. If using self-managed nodes, the EC2 instance usage would be billed normally.
        * However, if using managed node groups, the first 1,000 hours per month of t3.micro/t3.small instances across all AWS services are free. So a small EKS cluster could stay within the Free Tier limits.
        * Other AWS resources like EBS volumes, Elastic Load Balancers, etc used alongside the EKS cluster may or may not qualify depending on type, size and usage.
        * Services like ECR, EBS, S3, etc that are used to store and deploy container images/configurations are each subject to their own Free Tier policies.
        
        So in summary - the EKS control plane itself is always free, but other associated infrastructure costs like EC2 nodes may or may not fall under the Free Tier depending on specific configurations and usage. The AWS Free Tier page provides more details on usage limits. [2]
        Let me know if you have any other questions! Using managed node groups with EKS makes setting up containerd very simple compared to self-managed nodes where you need to install and configure it yourself on the instances.
