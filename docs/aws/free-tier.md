To check if your AWS account is eligible for the Free Tier or not, here are a few things you can do:

1. Log into the AWS Management Console with the account you want to check (link) . 
    Go to the AWS Billing Dashboard. 
    The dashboard will show you if your account is within the Free Tier limits or if it has exceeded them.
2. Check when your Free Tier period ends. New AWS accounts are eligible for the Free Tier benefits for 12 months from sign up. 
     The dashboard or your AWS billing reports will show the end date of your Free Tier period.
3. Review the Free Tier limits for each AWS service. Different services have different limits on the amount of free usage per month. 
     You can check the limits on the individual service pages on the AWS documentation website.
4. Monitor your usage across services. If your usage of a service is approaching its Free Tier limit, you will know your account may exceed the Free Tier benefits soon. 
     The AWS Cost Explorer tool can help you track usage and costs.
5. Contact AWS Support if needed.

Hello Igor,

I hope this email finds you well!

Since assisting you is my highest priority, I've tried to reach you on the phone number that we have associated to your AWS account in order to provide you with personal assistance and clarify your doubts, but unfortunately, I couldn't establish a connection with you as the call was routed to a voice mail box. However, I will be assisting over this email.

From the case notes, I understand that your use case is to create an EKS cluster with a EC2 t2.micro instance which is covered under the Free Tier promotion as per suggestion by Amazon Q, however you are unable to see the option to choose EC2 t2.micro instance as a worker nodes. 
I'm really sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused you and I'll do my best to help you with this.
