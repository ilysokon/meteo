To check if your AWS account is eligible for the Free Tier or not, here are a few things you can do:

1. Log into the AWS Management Console with the account you want to check (link) . 
    Go to the AWS Billing Dashboard. 
    The dashboard will show you if your account is within the Free Tier limits or if it has exceeded them.
2. Check when your Free Tier period ends. New AWS accounts are eligible for the Free Tier benefits for 12 months from sign up. 
     The dashboard or your AWS billing reports will show the end date of your Free Tier period.
3. Review the Free Tier limits for each AWS service. Different services have different limits on the amount of free usage per month. 
     You can check the limits on the individual service pages on the AWS documentation website.
4. Monitor your usage across services. If your usage of a service is approaching its Free Tier limit, you will know your account may exceed the Free Tier benefits soon. 
     The AWS Cost Explorer tool can help you track usage and costs.
5. Contact AWS Support if needed.
